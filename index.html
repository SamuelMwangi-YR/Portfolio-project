       <p><b> Professor at Seattle Central College: Jessica Rambus </b></p>

       <p>Samuel Mwangi was one of my best students.</p> 
       <p> He was enthusiastic, eager to learn and got along well with others.</p> 
       <p> He was also chosen to be a part of a college event where only 5 out of 30 students could attend.</p> 
       <p> Again, his eagerness for learning got him a seat in the room and he did well.</p> 
       <p> I am proud of where he is today and encourage him to always keep going.</p>
       <p> I think Samuel is great at ...</p>
       <p><b>creativity, initiative, resilience</b></p>

       <h3 class="subheader">Professional Refrence : 2</h3>

       <p>Samuel is self motivated and a deep thinker,</p> 
       <p> interested in the "Why" the commitment and dedication Samuel depicts is rare in one so young! </p>
       <p> He showed good team work, shy's away at times, but his Leadership is appreciated amongst his peers, his resilience and initiative second to none when problem solving.</p>
       <p> I think Samuel is great at ...</p>
