       <p><b> Professor at Seattle Central College: Jessica Rambus </b></p>

       <p>Samuel Mwangi was one of my best students.</p> 
       <p> He was enthusiastic, eager to learn and got along well with others.</p> 
       <p> He was also chosen to be a part of a college event where only 5 out of 30 students could attend.</p> 
       <p> Again, his eagerness for learning got him a seat in the room and he did well.</p> 
       <p> I am proud of where he is today and encourage him to always keep going.</p>
       <p> I think Samuel is great at ...</p>
       <p><b>creativity, initiative, resilience</b></p>
